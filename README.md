### ‚öôÔ∏è Motor Integration and Drive System

To ensure proper implementation of the **DC 12V encoder gear motor** and the **servo motor**, both a **motor driver** and a **mechanical differential** were selected as essential components of the drive system.

The encoder gear motor is responsible for powering the mechanical differential, which then distributes motion evenly to the rear wheels. This configuration was chosen due to the torque multiplication offered by the differential ‚Äî a key factor for achieving **precise maneuverability** within constrained environments, such as a competition playing field.

The integrated **gear reduction system** in the motor provides several advantages:
- Simplified mechanical design
- Enhanced power and torque output
- High durability due to the **sealed and enclosed housing**

This combination of components enables smooth, responsive, and reliable mobility suitable for both fine control and sustained movement under varying load conditions.

### üîå System Elements Overview

This section outlines the main hardware components integrated into the robot, including control units, sensors, power elements, and motor drivers.

---

#### üß† Microcontrollers and Computing Units

- **Arduino Uno + Custom Shield**  
  The Arduino Uno is used as the main microcontroller for low-level control tasks such as motor actuation and sensor readings. It is paired with a custom shield that facilitates connections with the motor driver, sensors, and power distribution. The shield also includes pins for voltage regulation and communication lines.

- **Raspberry Pi 5 (Model B)**  
  The Raspberry Pi 5 serves as the high-level processing unit, handling tasks such as path planning, camera data processing, and advanced control logic. Model B features a quad-core ARM Cortex-A76 processor running at 2.4GHz, up to 8GB RAM, dual 4K display output, USB 3.0 support, Gigabit Ethernet, built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 5.0.

#### üì∑ Vision System

- **Raspberry Pi Camera Module**  
  The robot is equipped with the official Raspberry Pi Camera Module, providing real-time video input for image-based navigation or line-following tasks. The camera is directly connected to the Pi via the CSI interface for low-latency image capture.

---

#### ‚öôÔ∏è Motors and Actuation

- **Motors Configuration**  
  The robot includes:
  - **1 DC Encoder Gearmotor** for rear-wheel drive (forward and backward motion).
  - **1 SG90 Servomotor** for steering the front wheels (left/right movement).

  These motors work together to allow omnidirectional navigation on a flat surface. Specifications include:
  - Torque: ~35 g¬∑cm
  - Speed range: 0.22 m/s (min) ‚Äì 0.71 m/s (max)  
  *(Note: 0.22 m/s is the robot's minimum effective speed; the motor itself can operate slower.)*

#### üîÑ Motor Driver

- **L298N Dual H-Bridge Motor Driver**  
  The L298N module is used to control the DC and servo motors. It consists of:
  - An L298 integrated motor driver IC
  - A 78M05 5V regulator (can be disabled via jumper)
  
  Features:
  - Can control up to 2 DC motors (direction + speed)
  - Can support 4 motors with simple on/off logic
  - Compatible with TTL logic levels (from Arduino or Pi)

#### üìè Distance and Motion Sensing

- **HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensors**  
  The robot uses **3 ultrasonic sensors** placed at the front, left, and right to detect obstacles and measure distances. Each sensor operates as follows:
  - Emits 8 ultrasonic pulses at 40kHz via the TRIG pin.
  - Detects reflected sound using the ECHO pin.
  - Measures time of flight to calculate distance (2‚Äì450 cm range).
  
  These sensors are not affected by sunlight or dark materials, but may struggle with acoustically soft surfaces (e.g., cloth or wool).

- **IMU Sensor (Inertial Measurement Unit)**  
  The robot includes an IMU sensor (e.g., MPU6050 or similar) that provides motion data through **gyroscope and accelerometer readings**. This allows:
  - Orientation tracking
  - Tilt detection
  - Smoother navigation control (especially in turns or uneven motion)

  The IMU is connected via I2C to the Arduino, which processes raw motion data or forwards it to the Raspberry Pi for sensor fusion and decision making.

#### üîã Power Supply

- **9V Battery Supply**  
  The robot is powered using a **9V battery**, which is connected through the custom Arduino shield to distribute power appropriately:
  - Motors receive power through the L298N driver module.
  - Logic-level devices (Arduino, sensors) receive regulated 5V from the onboard voltage regulators.
  
  Separation of motor and logic power ensures **stable performance**, reduces noise, and protects against voltage dips during motor stall.
