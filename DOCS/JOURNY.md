## üöÄ Development Journey

Our development process was not a straight path‚Äîit was a journey full of challenges, failures, learning, and improvements. Below is an overview of the key stages we went through:

---

### üõ†Ô∏è Step 1: First Steps with 3D Printing
- At the beginning, we struggled to learn how to design and work with **3D-printed parts**.  
- We tried creating our own designs, but the results were not practical.  
- Fortunately, we found an existing design online that fit our needs.  
- We made **major improvements and modifications** to adapt it to our project.  
- After printing the chassis, the result was promising, but a problem appeared:  
  - The **DC motor was longer than the chassis base**, causing fitting issues.  
- After several trials and adjustments, we solved this issue successfully.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Step 2: Motor Limitations and Upgrades
- The original **DC motor was too weak** and could not deliver enough power.  
- We replaced it with a **stronger and more efficient motor**.  
- This upgrade was not straightforward‚Äîwe faced difficulties with mounting and alignment.  
- With persistence, we managed to fix and stabilize the new motor in place.

### üîß Step 3: Servo Motor Challenges
- The first **servo motor** we used had **low torque**, which was not enough for proper steering.  
- We upgraded to a **high-torque servo motor**.  
- The new servo required **6V power**, but our system could not supply this directly.  
- To solve this:  
  - We combined **two 3.7V Li-ion batteries** in series to get **7.4V**.  
  - We used a **voltage regulator** to clean and stabilize the output at **6V**.  
- This solution powered the high-torque servo safely and reliably.

### üåü Conclusion
Every stage of our journey was a cycle of **trial and error**.  
Each challenge pushed us to learn and improve:  
- From mastering 3D printing,  
- To upgrading motors,  
- To solving power delivery issues.  

These experiences shaped our project into a **stronger, more reliable system**.
